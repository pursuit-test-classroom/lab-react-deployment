# React Deployment Lab

## Lab Setup

### Getting started

1. Create a new React app.

1. Open up the repository in VSCode. Follow the instructions below to complete the lab.

1. Deploy this application to Netlify and add the link to your Netlify site below:

- [MY LIVE SITE URL]()

## Instructions

Choose one of your former labs for HTML or CSS (no JavaScript interactivity or DOM manipulation) - like Intro to CSS, CSS Grid, or Media Queries.

Move and convert your solution to the old lab into the new React app. If you want to make minor updates or improvements, go for it, but it is unnecessary. The critical part is to create your own react app that works and host it online.

Follow the appropriate deployment instructions from the [guides repository](https://github.com/pursuit-curriculum-resources/guide-deployment)
